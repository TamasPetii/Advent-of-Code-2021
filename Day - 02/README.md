## PART - 1

For the proper algorithm create variables named as horizontal and depth with a starting value of 0 and then loop through the input list and. <br>
If the current list element contains "forward" add its valaue to horizontal. <br>
If the current list element contains "down" add its value to depth. <br>
If the current list element contains "up" subtract its value from depth.
Multiple the horizontal and depth variables and you're done with the first part.

<br>
For the proper algorithm create variables named as horizontal, depth and aim with a starting value of 0 and then loop through the input list and. <br>
If the current list element contains "forward" add its valaue to horizontal and add to depth the multiplication of the value of aim and the current element value. <br>
If the current list element contains "down" add its value to aim. <br>
If the current list element contains "up" subtract its value from aim.
Multiple the horizontal and depth variables and you're done with the second part.
