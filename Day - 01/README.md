## PART - 1

For the proper algorithm we need to loop either from 1 to end of list or from 0 to end of list - 1
For idea 1 you need to check if the list element at the current index if higher then the list element at current index  - 1.
For idea 2 you need to check if the list element at the current index + 1 if higher then the list element at current index.
Count all the occurrence mentioned above and your are done with part one.
